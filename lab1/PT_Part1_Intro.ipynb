    "PyTorch is a machine learning library, like TensorFlow. At its core, PyTorch provides an interface for creating and manipulating [tensors](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html), which are data structures that you can think of as multi-dimensional arrays. Tensors are represented as n-dimensional arrays of base datatypes such as a string or integer -- they provide a way to generalize vectors and matrices to higher dimensions. PyTorch provides the ability to perform computation on these tensors, define neural networks, and train them efficiently.\n",

    "The [```shape```](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.shape.html#torch.Tensor.shape) of a PyTorch tensor defines its number of dimensions and the size of each dimension. The `ndim` or [```dim```](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.dim.html#torch.Tensor.dim) of a PyTorch tensor provides the number of dimensions (n-dimensions) -- this is equivalent to the tensor's rank (as is used in TensorFlow), and you can also think of this as the tensor's order or degree.\n",

Subclassing affords the flexibility to define custom layers, custom training loops, custom activation functions, and custom models. Let's define the same neural network model as above (i.e., Linear layer with an activation function after it), now using subclassing and using PyTorch's built in linear layer from `nn.Linear`."

Now that we have a sense of how PyTorch's autograd can be used to compute and access derivatives, we will look at an example where we use automatic differentiation and SGD to find the minimum of $ L=(x-x_f)^2 $. Here $x_f$ is a variable for a desired value we are trying to optimize for; $L$ represents a loss that we are trying to minimize. While we can clearly solve this problem analytically ($ x_{min}=x_f $), considering how we can compute this using PyTorch's autograd sets us up nicely for future labs where we use gradient descent to optimize entire neural network losses."
